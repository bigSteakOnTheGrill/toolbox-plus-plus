# Toolbox++ (or Toolbox Plus Plus, toolbox-plus-plus)
#
In this first public export the toolbox contains a tool to generate Microsoft help files (chm-files). The intension is to get an index system, which relies on keywords instead solely on help IDs. Using keywords make the source code easier to read and keeping the references better in shape. The keywords can be used in C, C++ or VBA. For C and C++ these keywords can be arranged as enums, which makes even the programming easier.

There are other help generators like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen or https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/halibut/, which are more sophisticated (and in certain way more complicated).
